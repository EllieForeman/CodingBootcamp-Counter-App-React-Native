redux middleware to hook into your reducers under the hood
evert time the state is cnaged it will take the data and store it to disk on the file system. This mmeans it can be read again when your phone/app restarts.
when you re open app - the memory will 'reydrate' you store upon loading

this is opposed to storing in memeory
